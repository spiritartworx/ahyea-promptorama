## Overview

Ahyea! Promptorama! is designed to assist users in generating customized prompts that are tailored to their individual needs. With features such as user profiling, prompt versioning, and explainable AI, this platform enables both individual users and teams to collaborate and optimize prompt generation through machine learning models and human feedback loops.

The platform consists of the following components:
- **Prompt Generation Service**: Utilizes NLP models to generate relevant and creative prompts based on user input.
- **Prompt Storage & Retrieval Service**: Allows users to store and retrieve prompts efficiently, with search capabilities powered by Elasticsearch.
- **User Profile Service**: Personalizes the experience for users based on their preferences and history.
- **Output Generation Service**: Supports multi-modal outputs like text, images, or other forms of content, utilizing models like GPT-3 and DALL-E.
- **Explainable AI**: Provides transparency into how AI decisions are made.
